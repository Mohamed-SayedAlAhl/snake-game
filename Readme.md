# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Python. The objective of the game is to move a snake around a grid, eating apples to grow longer and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Alternatively, you can download an executable version of the game from the releases page on GitHub. This version does not require Python to be installed on your computer and can be run by double-clicking the file.

## Installation

To install the game from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-SayedAlAhl/snake-game.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd snake-game`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install pygame`

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command in the project directory:

```
python snake_game.py
```

The game window should appear, and you can use the arrow keys to move the snake. Press `p` to pause and resume the game and `+` or `-` to change the speed of the snake.

Alternatively, you can double-click the executable file if you downloaded it from the releases page.

## Functionality

The game includes the following features:

- A snake that grows longer when it eats an apple
- A scoreboard that keeps track of the player's score
- A game over screen that appears when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail
- A high score system that saves the player's highest score to a file

## Conclusion

This implementation of the Snake game is a fun and challenging project that demonstrates the power and versatility of Python. It can be customized and extended in many ways, such as adding new features or improving the graphics. Feel free to experiment and have fun with it!
